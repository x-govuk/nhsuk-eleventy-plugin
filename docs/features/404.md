When someone visits a page that does not exist on your site, most static website hosts will show a custom 404 error page if you provide one in a certain location, such as `404.html` at the top level of your site.

The NHS.UK Eleventy Plugin creates a 404 page that can help users understand what happened and how to find what they need.{.red}

> [!NOTE]
> View an [example 404 page (opens in a tab)](/example/404){target=example}

By default the 404 page tells users:

> If you typed the web address, check it is correct.
>
> If you pasted the web address, check you copied the entire address.
>
> You can browse from [the homepage](/) or use the [sitemap](/sitemap) to find the information you need.

## Configure the 404 page

The plugin enables the 404 page by default. To turn it off, set `templates.error404` to `false` in your plugin options.

Or, you can customise the page by using these options:

{% from "govuk/components/table/macro.njk" import govukTable %}
{{ govukTable({
  caption: "Feature options",
  captionClasses: "govuk-table__caption--m",
  firstCellIsHeader: true,
  head: [
    { text: "Name" },
    { text: "Type" },
    { text: "Description" }
  ],
  rows: [
    [
      { text: "title" },
      { text: "string" },
      { text: "Sets the page title (default is `Page not found`)" | markdown }
    ],
    [
      { text: "content" },
      { text: "string" },
      { text: "Sets the page content using Markdown (default content shown above)" | markdown }
    ],
    [
      { text: "permalink" },
      { text: "string" },
      { text: "Sets the file name and location (default is `/404.html`). Set to `false` to disable writing this file to the output folder." | markdown }
    ]
  ]
}) }}

## Change how the 404 page looks

The 404 page uses the [error layout](/layouts/error). You can override this layout to change how the page appears.

## Replace the 404 page

You can create your own 404 page that replaces this one. To do this, create a page that saves to the same location (by default `/404.html`).

When you do this, your page will be used instead of the pluginâ€™s default.
