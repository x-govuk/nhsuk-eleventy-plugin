The NHS.UK Eleventy Plugin provides different layouts you can choose from, which you can use on different parts of your site:

{% for page in collections.layout | includes("data.theme", "Content presentation") %}

- [{{ page.data.title }}]({{ page.url }}) – {{ page.data.description }}

{% endfor %}

The plugin also provides the following layouts used by features. It is unlikely you will need to use these for any content pages:

{% for page in collections.layout | includes("data.theme", "Feature layouts") %}

- [{{ page.data.title }}]({{ page.url }})

{% endfor %}

## Overriding layouts

Layouts provided by this plugin can be overridden, or used as a basis for your own, by using Nunjuck’s [template inheritance](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#template-inheritance) feature.

For example, to show a notification banner at the top of each page that uses the Page layout, add a file named `_includes/page.njk` with the following content:

```njk
{% raw %}{# Plugin layouts can be loaded from "layouts" #}
{% extends "layouts/page.njk" %}

{# Load any GOV.UK Frontend components #}
{% from "govuk/components/notification-banner/macro.njk" import govukNotificationBanner %}

{# Override the `content` block #}
{% block content %}
  {# Templates can include front matter data #}
  {% if reviewed and reviewAgain %}
    <p>This page was last reviewed on {{ reviewed | nhsukDate }}.
    It needs to be reviewed again on {{ reviewAgain | nhsukDate }}.</p>
  {% endif %}

  {{ appDocumentHeader({
    title: title,
    description: description
  }) }}

  {{ appProseScope(content) if content }}
{% endblock %}{% endraw %}
```

You can extend the following layouts:

{%- for layoutFilename in layoutFilenames %}

- `layouts/{{ layoutFilename }}`

{%- endfor %}
{##}

Replacement layouts must share the same name and saved in your [configured layout directory](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/#directory-for-layouts-optional).
