Once a juggler has submitted their application via the Apply service, the application will become available over the API.

Providers can then use the API for:

- [Retrieving applications](#)
- [Approving applications](#)
- [Rejecting unsuccessful applications](#)

To get an idea of how the API works, [review the example usage scenarios](#).

## Authentication and authorisation

Requests to the API must be accompanied by an authentication token.

Each token is associated with a single licencing authority. It will grant access to applications for courses offered by or accredited by that provider.

For instructions on how to authenticate, see the [API reference](#).
