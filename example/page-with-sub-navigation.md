Your service must be accessible to everyone who needs it. If itâ€™s not, you may be breaking the law.

Everyone who works on NHS digital services has a role to play in making them accessible and inclusive.

## Make sure your service meets Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2

The service manual is up to date with WCAG 2.2.

[Find out more about the new criteria that WCAG 2.2 introduced](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/accessibility/new-criteria-in-wcag-2-2).

The Government Digital Service, Department of Health and Social Care and NHS England are now monitoring accessibility to WCAG 2.2.
